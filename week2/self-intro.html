    <h1>Seow Lee Jing</h1>
    <h2>Even miracles take a little time</h2>
    <p>Hiiii, I'm Lee Jing.
        Most of the time, I'm just daydreaming, watching dramas, chasing idols, and checking out handsome guys.
        Sometimes I suddenly become hardworking… but only sometimes. I like simple and comfy vibes and a little bit of
        that “small ceremony” feeling in life.
        Life doesn't need to rush, just take it slow and enjoy the ride.</p>
    <p>Sometimes I really enjoy the little moments...like lying in bed with the aircon on, watching dramas, variety
        shows or just chatting with friends.
        I don't like living life in a rush, I think everything has its own timing.
        As long as I'm happy in the moment, that's already enough for me.</p>
