    <p>Zayn Malik (born January 12, 1993, in Bradford, England) is a British singer and songwriter who first became
        famous as a member of the boy band One Direction. He joined the group in 2010 after joining The X Factor UK as a
        solo contestant, and soon won hearts around the world with his charming looks and soulful voice. Together with
